# 🧠 Customer Segmentation - Clustering

This project focuses on identifying different customer segments using clustering algorithms. By grouping similar customers based on their attributes, businesses can tailor marketing strategies more effectively.

## 📊 Project Overview

Using demographic and spending data, this notebook applies clustering techniques to discover patterns in customer behavior. The analysis includes visualizations, KMeans, and Hierarchical Clustering to form distinct customer segments.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Algorithms Applied

- **KMeans Clustering**
- **Elbow Method** (to find optimal number of clusters)
- **Silhouette Score** (to evaluate clustering quality)
- **Hierarchical Clustering**
- **Dendrogram Analysis**

## 📁 Files

- `Customer Segmentation - Clustering.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the full analysis and clustering process.

## ✅ Workflow

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**
2. **Data Cleaning and Scaling**
3. **Data Visualization**
4. **Applying Clustering Algorithms**
5. **Interpreting the Segments**

## 📷 Visual Insights

- Elbow chart to determine the best number of clusters.
- Dendrogram plot for hierarchical clustering.
- PCA-based 2D visualization of clusters.

## 🎯 Use Cases for Segments

- Personalized marketing campaigns
- Better understanding of customer behavior
- Customer value prioritization
- Product recommendation strategies
